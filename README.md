Number Theory Python Package

This is a pure python 3 package containing some number theory modules. It was created to work with
quadratic fields, quadratic orders, quadratic forms and integral quadratic ideals. For example, one can represent
elements in the ring of Gaussian integers and add them together, compute their powers, etc. One can also find a set 
of reduced positive definite binary quadratic forms. This can the be used to compute the class number of imaginary
quadratic fields.
